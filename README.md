## Credits
- [unbeGames's noise algorithm](https://github.com/unbeGames/noise.git) is used for faster noise generation and the backbone of the planets looks
- [Video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTdn3CC64sc&list=PLVsTSlfj0qsWt0qafrT6blp5yvchzO4ee) was used to create the marching cubes terrain with minor adjustments from me.
