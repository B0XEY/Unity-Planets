[^1]: These planets use 3D noise to shape the terrain. This is not the best option because of the lack of control. Thankfully [unbeGames's noise algorithm](https://github.com/unbeGames/noise.git) not only is jobs/ burst enabled but makes layered noise much faster than using normal librays.
[^2]: The Terrian is made using the marching cube algorithm. The base of my code comes from this [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTdn3CC64sc&list=PLVsTSlfj0qsWt0qafrT6blp5yvchzO4ee) with was a big help with the generation. I have made minor tweaks and changes to speed up the generation. [Scrawk's Marching Cubes Project](https://github.com/Scrawk/Marching-Cubes)
